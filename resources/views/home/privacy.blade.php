                            <p>SportsJun requires users to register for the service and provide personal information including but not limited to the user's name, zip code and email address. SportsJun uses this information to establish and deliver service to the individual. SportsJun may use this information to contact registered users to notify them of product and service updates, provide instruction, and to deliver other service related information. SportsJun may also contact users to request additional information and feedback. SportsJun may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to establish and deliver service to the individual. SportsJun's agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks. SportsJun will not disclose registration information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with SportsJun, without your consent or as otherwise stated in this privacy policy. If at some point SportsJun sells all or a portion of its assets, customer information is one of those assets that would be transferred or acquired by a third party; the third party would then have the right to continue using the personal information as set forth in this policy. For more information see SportsJun's Privacy Policy Changes section below. SportsJun may release or exchange personal information if required to do so to comply with applicable law or to enforce its rights or agreements or prevent fraud or reduce credit risk.

The emails are for the sole purpose of notifying individuals about upcoming sports events.</p>
